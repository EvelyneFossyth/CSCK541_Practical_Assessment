### CSCK541 Software Development in Practice Jan 2023 B 
## Practical Assessment: Programming
**What is this project about?**\
This project should show the ability of the student to:
- write a code in Python according to PEP standards
- share the code with others using source control 
- understand the difference between iterative and recursive functions
- practice in writing unit and performance tests
- create correct documentation

**What is the topic of the project?**\
The Floyd Warshall Algorithm was re-written in Python using recursion. After that performance of the new code was compared to the iterative version. 

**How to install**\
Two libraries (Floyd_Recursive and Random_Graph) are not built-in modules in Python,
but rather modules that were created by the autor of this project. They are included in the distribution package (the zip file).

**How to run**\
From the provided zip file:
- run the *Floyd_Recursive.py* file to see the re-written code
- run the *Performance_Test.py* file to see the comparison of the performance
- the *tests* folder contains unit tests for the parts of the recursive code, in case there would be an error rising up
